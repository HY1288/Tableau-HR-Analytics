# Tableau-HR-Analytics

### Project Summary
This Tableau project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition, highlighting key metrics and trends. The dashboard displays overall employee count, attrition rate, and active employees, along with the average age of employees. This project demonstrates my ability to use data visualization to derive actionable insights, helping HR teams identify retention risks and areas for engagement improvement.

### Key insights include:

    * Department-wise Attrition: Visualizes attrition distribution across departments, with R&D experiencing the highest attrition.
    * Attrition by Age Group: Shows the distribution of employees by age, helping to identify which age groups are more prone to leave.
    * Job Satisfaction by Role: Highlights satisfaction levels across different job roles, providing insights into areas where employee engagement may be low.
    * Education Field-wise Attrition: Analyzes attrition based on employees' educational backgrounds.
    * Attrition by Gender and Age Group: Compares attrition rates between genders across various age groups, revealing patterns in demographic-specific turnover.
